    <h1>What is Bouldering?</h1>
    <p>
        Bouldering is a sport developed as an accesible and safe way to train difficult climbing techniques for bigger climbs. 
        It invloves climbing short routes without a harness and rope but over a crash pad instead. Solving and climbing the routes 
        or "boulder problems"(as they are called), often requires analyzing them carefully which provides a great challenge for 
        those who not only want a great workout but like solving puzzles as-well.
