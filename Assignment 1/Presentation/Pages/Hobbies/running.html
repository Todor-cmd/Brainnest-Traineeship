    <h1>What is running?</h1>
    <p>
        This activity is pretty self explanatory I believe but according to 
        <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/run">webster's dictionary</a>, this activity involves
         "springing steps so that both feet leave the ground for an instant in each step". The pace one runs at is a 
         personal choice and is usually based what the person aims to achieve by running.
